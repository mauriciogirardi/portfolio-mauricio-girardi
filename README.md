### About me

ðŸš€ Hello! Iâ€™m Mauricio Girardi, a passionate
**Front-end Develope** with
a solid background in creating amazing digital experiences.
My main
focus is on technologies like
**ReactJS**,
**Next.js**,
**Node.js**,
**React Native** and more.

Currently, I work as a
**Front-end Develope** in
projects that use ReactJS and Next.js to create intuitive and
responsive interfaces. My experience with Node.js allows me to
efficiently integrate the front-end and back-end, ensuring
exceptional performance.

Iâ€™m always looking for challenges that broaden my horizons and
opportunities to collaborate with talented teams. If you are looking
for a committed and passionate developer, ready to face new
challenges.

I am open to new opportunities and collaborations. Letâ€™s create
something amazing together? Iâ€™m excited to be part of your next
project!
